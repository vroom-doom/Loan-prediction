# Loan-Prediction
My first Machine Learning project using sklearn library in Python

After doing a training course on Machine Learning using Python and using sklearn library, I have made a model on Loan Prediction, where the model predicts whether a loan is valid or not based on the data in a csv file.
Here the data has been cleaned for use and visualised, then divided into training and test datasets.
Then I used a decision tree classifier and then fit it onto the data.
Finally, the model was tested for accuracy and a confusion matrix was plotted for visualising the results better.
